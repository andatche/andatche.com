<p>I&#8217;ve started running a <a href="http://www.minecraft.net/">Minecraft</a> server for some family &#038; friends. Details below&#8230;</p>
<p>
<strong>Hostname:</strong> minecraft.andatche.com<br />
<strong>IPv4:</strong> 109.107.36.27<br />
<strong>IPv6:</strong> 2a02:1348:14d:6c81:24:19ff:fea1:b206<br />
<strong>Port:</strong> 25565<br />
<strong>Map:</strong> <a href="http://minecraft.andatche.com">http://minecraft.andatche.com</a></p>
<h3>Whitelist</h3>
<p>In a bid to prevent vandalism and abuse, players must be whitelisted to gain access to the server. If you&#8217;d like whitelisting please take a quick look at the <a href="#rules">rules</a> and email ben@andatche.com with your Minecraft username. The current whitelist is available <a href="http://minecraft.andatche.com/white-list.txt">here</a>.</p>
<h3>Map</h3>
<p>A &#8220;Google Maps&#8221; style overview of the current world is available <a href="http://minecraft.andatche.com">here</a>. The map is generated using <a href="https://github.com/equalpants/pigmap">pigmap</a> with <strong>B=16</strong>, <strong>T=1</strong> and <strong>Z=6</strong> using the standard texture pack and is re-generated every 30 mins. Currently, with 4 threads it takes about 60 seconds to completely render the world.</p>
<h3>Server Config</h3>
<ul>
<li>Monsters are <strong>on</strong></li>
<li>Animals are <strong>on</strong></li>
<li>PvP is <strong>on</strong></li>
<li>Nether is <strong>on</strong></li>
<li>World backups are every <strong>4 hours</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The server currently has 4GB of RAM and 8 CPU cores, so it should have enough grunt for a while &#8211; the world is only ~10MB at the moment. The server config is currently open to debate, if you think something should be changed, let me know!</p>
<h3 id="rules">Rules</h3>
<p>Nobody likes rules, but Minecraft is best when we work together so please&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t destroy what others have built.</strong> The server has lots of RAM so there should be enough space for everybody. If you&#8217;re struggling for space, explore a little!</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t steal resources.</strong> Don&#8217;t steal other people&#8217;s items.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t destroy the environment.</strong> Don&#8217;t start fires or destroy areas of the environment outside of the immediate area you live in. Mining is obviously OK though!</li>
</ul>
