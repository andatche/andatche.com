#Code

Various software projects I've written or contributed to in some way. For more, see my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/andatche).

### Arduino

* [LCD03 Arduino library](/code/arduino/lcd03/) - An Arduino library for I2C control of the LCD03 20x4 and 16x2 serial LCD modules from [Robot Electronics](http://www.robot-electronics.co.uk/htm/Lcd03tech.htm).

### Ruby

* [andatche.com](https://github.com/andatche/andatche.com) - The nanoc configuration powering this website.
* [Brightbox nanoc helpers](https://github.com/brightbox/brightbox-nanoc-helpers) - A useful collection of nanoc helpers to improve blogging (Added Atom feed generation)
* [nyancat gem](https://github.com/andatche/ruby_nyancat) - A Ruby port of the original nyancat CLI by [Kevin Lange](https://github.com/klange/nyancat), packaged as a [gem](https://rubygems.org/gems/nyancat).

### Misc

* [raspi-linux](https://github.com/andatche/raspi-linux) - A (deprecated) kernel tree I maintained for the Raspberry Pi. This is no longer maintained, many of the patches are now included in the official RPi kernel tree. The 3.1.x kernel contains some [nasty security issues](http://www.bootc.net/archives/2012/06/12/why-i-wont-support-a-3-1-kernel/) and should be avoided.
* [centos-grub](https://github.com/andatche/centos-grub) - A CentOS 5.x package for Grub 0.97, patched to support booting from GUID (uEFI) partition tables. Unmaintained.
