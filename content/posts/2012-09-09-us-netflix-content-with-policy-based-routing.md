The range of content available on [Netflix](http://www.netflix.com/) in the US is far greater than that available here in the UK. A quick Google search turns up pages of simple guides on how to get access to the US content using VPNs or DNS hijacking. The problem with most of these solutions is that they result in the streaming content being delivered from CDN locations in the US too, rather than from a more local CDN node, resulting in poor performance and reduced video quality.
