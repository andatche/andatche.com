In a hasty decision to better organise my online life and to encourage me to write more, I’ve finally got round to getting my website back online. 2010 brought lots of new-then-quickly-abandoned projects I’d like to resurrect, I’m hoping that talking/blogging about them will help me stay interested and perhaps raise a bit of interest in some of them from other people. How successful this will be remains to be seen!
